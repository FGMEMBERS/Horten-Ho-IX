----------Changelog End------------ ------- ------- ------- ---- which not other diclared by Cpt Goosnen 2013 ----

This is a developer preview version, 
FDM has become more real datas, via "Cpt Haddock's" rework
if u wish the old yasim, just take the yasim file in the "alte-Ho-IX" folder
there are all files which changed in the original state (helijahs last update feb 2013)

Notes:

if u have problems with takeoff, try a 100% flat runway (i think thats an yasim bug, but im not shure)
also full Elevator!!! which u hopefully done already ;) and steer with brakes rather than rudder !!!

-take off Key Procedure-
Hold "page up" some seconds
Hold "2" some seconds
push shift-b

thats it..

The indicator lights for flaps ar not original, in the V2 prototypes they had have a "rollschauzeichen" that means 
it was a simple sign, not a light... but i think when they had have build the V3 they surly had used lights.... 
the panel isnt ready..

and the 2 switshes for lights at the left, i have include for that u can choose if lights or not ;)
left one is Taxi Lights, right one Nav Lights

it isnt ready!!!
just preview!!

Contact "Cpt Goosnen" in FG Forum for all kind of critic or help!
